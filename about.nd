# About Yakshas-v1

## Vision: Linux for the AI Era

**Yakshas-v1** is a universal agent platform—what Linux is to operating systems, Yakshas-v1 is to intelligent automation. We're democratizing automation for everyone.

**Core Beliefs:**
- Autonomy should be accessible (not locked behind enterprise walls)
- Agents should learn *your* patterns, not the other way around
- Anyone should extend capabilities via open-source + plugins
- Your data, your rules, your infrastructure

## Mission: 5 Pillars

1. **Automates Everything** — Phones, computers, cloud services, third-party systems
2. **Learns Continuously** — Improves from interactions, generates reusable skills
3. **Adapts to You** — Learns preferences, predicts needs, adapts communication
4. **Runs Anywhere** — Local (Ollama), cloud (Claude/Gemini/Grok), or hybrid
5. **Stays Private** — Default local, opt-in cloud, full audit trail

## Why Yakshas-v1?

**The Gap:** Current automation is fragmented (Zapier is simple but limited; RPA is powerful but closed; LLM APIs are smart but stateless; custom scripts are fragile).

**The Solution:** Multi-agent orchestration + persistent memory + 100+ tools + pluggable LLMs + event-driven workflows + digital soul that learns you.

## We Need You

**Engineers:** Tool builders, LLM integrators, architects, security researchers, frontend/mobile devs  
**ML/AI:** Reinforcement learning, memory systems, behavioral modeling  
**Community:** Writers, managers, educators, translators  
**Ideas:** Power users, domain experts, designers

## Design Principles

✓ Modular & composable (swap anything: LLMs, memory, tools)  
✓ Learn from everything (every action generates data)  
✓ Fail gracefully & self-heal  
✓ Transparent & auditable (log all decisions)  
✓ Privacy first, cloud optional  
✓ Infinitely extensible

## How to Contribute

1. Fork & create feature branch
2. Pick an issue (`good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`)
3. Implement, test, document
4. Submit PR — we'll review & merge

Or open an issue to discuss ideas, report bugs, request features.

## The Vision

**Agent for Everyone.**

Like Linux for billions (servers, phones, IoT), Yakshas-v1 becomes the autonomous agent for billions—enabling anyone, anywhere to automate anything.
